## Background
This final project is for the CFG course competition. We used the techniques and methods we learned in the past weeks on the course to work on a realistic data science problem. This notebook is the presentation of our work. 

## Task
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the UK. According to NHS, about 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and early detection will significantly increase the chance of recovery.

This notebook will explore the data from our client, a medical research company. We have been asked to improve the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning.  

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model which predicts whether the cancer is **benign or malignant**.
